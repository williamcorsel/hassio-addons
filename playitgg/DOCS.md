# Home Assistant Playit.gg Add-on

Playit.gg is a global proxy that allows anyone to host a server without port forwarding. We use tunneling. Only the server needs to run the program, not every player!

## Quick Configuration Guide

1. If you don't already have a Playit.gg account, head over to Playit.gg and sign up.
2. In Home Assistant, navigate to "Supervisor" > "Add-on Store" and search for the Playit.gg add-on. Once found, install and start it, then go to the "Log" tab.
3. Find the claim link and go through the claim process to add your node to your Playit.gg account.
4. Finally, check the add-on logs to ensure the add-on has successfully connected to your Playit.gg account.
